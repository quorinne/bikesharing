# Bikesharing
# Overview of our Analysis
CitiBike is a bicycle sharing service located in New York city. It is a profitable business that gives someone a fun way to travel within New York. It allows someone to avoid traffic jams and take in a scenic view of New York.  It also allows them to stop and speak with fellow cyclists and pedestrians.  Our goal is to determine if starting a bike rental business in Des Moines, Iowa would be profitable. In order to do this, we are using a csv file provided by CitiBike and looking at the month of August. We will need to change the measure of the column ‘Tripduration’ from seconds to hours, minutes and seconds. We did this via Pandas and exported the data into a new csv file we then analyzed with Tableau. 

# Results:
For this analysis we created 7 different visualizations with Tableau: Checkout Times for Users, Checkout Times by Gender, Trips by Weekday for Each Hour, Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour), User Trips by Gender by Weekday, Top Starting Locations and Top Ending Locations. These 7 visualizations have allowed me to make certain conclusions regarding the data.

According to the visualization above checkout times hit a high peak at around 5 minutes. This indicates that many people change their minds shortly after renting a bike.

This visualization indicates that there are more male customers than female customers and that both groups hit a checkout peak around 5minutes.

The above visualization lets us see the busiest hours of each weekday. In it we can see that Weekdays get most of their customers between the hours of 5am-9am and 5pm – 9pm while they have very few customers between 10am – 4pm. Saturdays and Sundays get most of their customers between 10am-5pm. The slowest period is between 4am-6am for every day of the week.

The visualization above is almost exactly like the previous viz but it allows us to see the breakdown of gender. The hours the different gender ride most frequently is the same, but we can see that there are more male customers than female or unknown.

In the visualization above we can see that Male, Female, and Undeclared customers all ride most often on Thursdays than any other day of the week.

In the Images above we can see a visual representation of starting and ending bike rental locations. In these images we see that the majority of starting locations and ending locations are in the same area. This area happened to be Manhattan which makes sense as it is the busiest part of New York City and a popular tourist destination. 


# Summary
According to the visualization we have created with our data a bike sharing business can be very profitable in large cities and starting one in Des Moines Iowa has the potential be successful. The month of August in New York saw 2,344,224 rides. This indicates a demand for such a service. However, I would want more information before I felt comfortable making this decision. Des Moines Iowa with a population of 215,408 is only a fraction of the size of New York with a population around 8.38 million. New York is also one of the most famous cities in the USA which means they see a huge number of tourists. This means that the number of potential clients in Des Moines is going to be much smaller than NY. 
Before making any decision, I would like to analyze data for the overall year and the colder months, either December or January. This would help determine if a bike sharing business could remain open year-round or if it would be a seasonal endeavor. 
I also want to perform another visualization with data collected from Des Moines. Specifically, I would like to look at data collected from whichever department deals with tourism to determine a rough estimate of potential cyclists. 
I would also want a geographical breakdown before making this decision. New York is an ideal place to bike to-and-fro. It is mostly flat making cycling easy.  Unfortunately, a cursory google search of Des Moines gives conflicting information regarding its level of flatness. As someone from a mountain town I can promise you this, regardless of how fun, easy or scenic it may be and despite the size of the population no one will pay to bike uphill. I am uncertain as to where I would get this information though. I rather doubt the city of Des Moines has a record of every hill in their city. I would likely need to commission a survey of the city, or ride through the city on a bike myself.
